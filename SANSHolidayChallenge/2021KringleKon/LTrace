==LTrace==
Location: Kitchen
Elf: Tinsel Upatree
Description:
The program "make_the_candy" is missing a configuration file.
You need to recreate a configuration file.
You are provided with the "ltrace" tool

The ltrace tool prints the line of code where the program halts.
You can iterative recreate the file by observing the ltrace error and making the file in such a way that the error doesn't occur.
ltrace firstly tells you it cant find the registration file "Registration.json"
Then after making blankfile it will give an error "unregistered"

We need to make a json file that is registered.
Solution: echo -n "Registration:True"
