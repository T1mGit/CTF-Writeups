Elf: Fitzy Shortstack

--{Description}--
The Critical Elf Application is not working because the Yara virus scan blocks it.
Please help Fitzy - He tells you that changing inocuous part of the program can bypass the scanner

--{Solution}--
Run the "Critical Elf Application", it prints the Yara rule that halt the program.
You cannot edit the Yara Rules but you can examine the in the a text editor (eg nano).
You are able to use the 'xxd' program to hex dump the application binary and edit the hexdump in the text editor.
the 'xxd' program will also reverse a hexdump into the binary executable.

STEP 1
Delete "candycane" from the binary

strings:
	$s=candycane
condition:
	$s

STEP2
Both of these hex strings must exists to activate the rule. 
The 'Libc.so' must stay but the other can be deleted.

strings:
	$s=6c 6962 632e 736f 2e36 - (Libc.so)
	$s=726f 6772 616d 2121 - (rogram!!)

condition:
	all of them
STEP 3
The strings are not important because there are only 5 anomalous strings that could be candidates for deletion.
Hence the condition '10 of them' will be satisfied by the remaining strings.
The easiest way is to increase the filesize above 50Kb by adding zeroes and occasional one.

strings: 
	$s=This is critical for the execution of this program!!
	$s=naughty string
	$=dastardly string
	$s=its_a_holly_jolly_variable
	$s=HolidayHackChallenge{NotReallyAFlag}
	(There are actually 20 strings, not all are shown)
Condition:
	uint32(1) ==0x02464c45 and filesize<50KB and 10 of them
