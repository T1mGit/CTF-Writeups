# SUMMARY OF LEARNINGS
1. Concatenate with 'cat' command basics.
2. Obscure filenames: period '.' hyphen '-'
  1.	The hyphen is tricky. use ./- to refer to it.
3. File type info with 'file' command and wild cards '*'
4. The 'find' command to locate files based on various metadata properties
5. The 'grep' command to search for strings in files with sophisticated pattern matching
6. The 'sort' command for sorting lines of text
7. the 'uniq' command for finding unique lines or excluding them
8. The 'strings' command is very good at find human readable strings in arbitrary files
9. the 'base64' to encode and decode base64 strings
10. The 'tr' translate command which rotates, translates, and expands text. very good for rot-n ciphers
11. file compression with 'zip', 'gunzip' , 'bzip2' 'bunzip2' 'tar'
12. SSH Remote shell and command execution 'ssh'
13. netcat 'nc' shovels data across a network
14. Task scheduling with 'cron'
15. Write your very first bash script
16. The VI text editor. Awsome command interface that I haven't yet bothered to learn, except that you can launch a shell from it.
   1.  Actually I have a great book "The Linux Command Line" which talk quite alot about VI, so I really should learn it.
17. Start OpenSSL with 'openssl s_client'
18. How use git. 'git log' 'git tag' 'git add' 'git commit' 'git push' 'git branch'
19. Shell Expansion Characters
