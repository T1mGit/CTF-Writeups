This is the walkthrough for the Over the Wire - Natas levls

The login for the very first level is:
URL - http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org
username : natas0
password : natas0

The Natas levels have a <div id=content> section which contains the actual challenge content.
The other div and header sections are unrelated to the challenge (at least in the low levels!!)


+++{ LEVEL 0 }+++
1) The password is found by opening the html inspector developer panel.
RMB > inspect element (F12 works in firefox)
The password is written in a comment in the html seen by expanding the html.

username: natas1
password:gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto

+++{ LEVEL 1 }+++
1) The solution is the same as level 0 but right button click is disabled.
F12 still works, or use menu

username:natas2
password:ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi

+++{ LEVEL 2 }+++
1)Open the source html browser and you'll notice a strange 1 pixel image the source of which is "files/pixel"
2)This indicates there is a directory named "files". Type this in the URL.
3) URL - http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files - you'll discover the file "users.txt"
4) The password for natas3 is in "users.txt"

password: sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14

+++{ LEVEL 3 }+++
1) Often web server use a file named "robots.txt" intended to stop web crawlers from indexing certain directories.
robots.txt is usually located at the root ie. /robots.txt
2) go to /robots.txt it lists a directory "Disallow:/s3cr3t/" go to the /s3cr3t/ directory.
3) there is another "users.txt" in that directory containing the password.

[
 Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"
 while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"
]
2)This challeng requires a tool called "Burpsuit" or similar.
3)It is necessary to intercept the http request from the browser before it leaves our computer.
4)We need change the 'Referer Header' which is sent in the GET request.
5)The Refer Header contains the URL of the website we have come from. We have to change it to exactly the URL the challenge is asking for.
6)Change the referer header EXACTLY inlcude trailing slash and we get password

2) Again with burpsuite intercept proxy - we discover a cookie with a field "loggedin=0"
3) change the value to "loggedin=1" and forward the request to get the password.
