This is the walkthrough for the Over the Wire - Natas levls

The login for the very first level is:
URL - http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org
username : natas0
password : natas0

The Natas levels have a <div id=content> section which contains the actual challenge content.
The other div and header sections are unrelated to the challenge (at least in the low levels!!)


+++{ LEVEL 0 }+++
1) The password is found by opening the html inspector developer panel.
RMB > inspect element (F12 works in firefox)
The password is written in a comment in the html seen by expanding the html.

username: natas1
password:gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto

+++{ LEVEL 1 }+++
1) The solution is the same as level 0 but right button click is disabled.
F12 still works, or use menu

username:natas2
password:ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi

+++{ LEVEL 2 }+++
1)Open the source html browser and you'll notice a strange 1 pixel image the source of which is "files/pixel"
2)This indicates there is a directory named "files". Type this in the URL.
3) URL - http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files - you'll discover the file "users.txt"
4) The password for natas3 is in "users.txt"

password: sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14

+++{ LEVEL 3 }+++
1) Often web server use a file named "robots.txt" intended to stop web crawlers from indexing certain directories.
robots.txt is usually located at the root ie. /robots.txt
2) go to /robots.txt it lists a directory "Disallow:/s3cr3t/" go to the /s3cr3t/ directory.
3) there is another "users.txt" in that directory containing the password.

+++{ LEVEL 4 }+++
1) Click the link to refresh the page a couple of times, you'll the following message:
[
 Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"
 while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"
]
2)This challeng requires a tool called "Burpsuit" or similar.
3)It is necessary to intercept the http request from the browser before it leaves our computer.
4)We need change the 'Referer Header' which is sent in the GET request.
5)The Refer Header contains the URL of the website we have come from. We have to change it to exactly the URL the challenge is asking for.
6)Change the referer header EXACTLY inlcude trailing slash and we get password

+++{ LEVEL 5}+++
1) This time the challenge says:
[
 Access denied. You are not logged in.
]
2) Again with burpsuite intercept proxy - we discover a cookie with a field "loggedin=0"
3) change the value to "loggedin=1" and forward the request to get the password.

+++{ LEVEL 6 }+++
1) The challenge asks for some text input into a single field form submission.
It is supposed to be the secret code to access the next level password.
2) The server side code is provided to you.
3) Examine the server side code and see the line :

    include "includes/secret.inc";

4) The 'include' directive causes the code on the specified file to be included in the php script.
You should NOT be able to navigate to this directory - this is a directory traversal flaw.
5) Navigate to the included file: /includes/secret.inc" and look in the source explorer window to find the comment telling your the secret code that goes in the input field.

+++{LEVEL 7}+++
1)This seems to be another directory traversal. Check the source inspector for coments. There is a hint telling you where the password is
2)If you try just navigating to the file via putting it in url: /natas_webpass/natas8
It does not work - file is not found.
3) Notice click the hyperlinks 'home' and 'about' changes url to a page parameter.
index.pgp?page=home -or- page=about
4)instead try page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8
5)it dumps the password

password: DBfUBfqQG69KvJvJ1iAbMoIpwSNQ9bWe

+++{LEVEL 8}+++
1)Another form input. The server side is provided and gives you the encoded secret and the function which encodes
2)It is simple using php to do the reverse (decode) function.
3) Server side does this:

  $encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

  function encodeSecret($secret) {
      return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
  }

4) You need to do the reveres. PHP can be called from command line:

  php -r '$e=base64_decode(strrev(hex2bin("3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362")),true); print $e;'

5) The above command will print the secret value for you: 'oubWYf2kBq'
   You need to type in to the form to get the password.
